# Computer Vision Path

AI projects have a lot of code behind them. I believe that the best way of becoming a better programmer is to write every line of code. This is why I've written the code for all these notebooks from scratch.

### Technologies used:

- Python, numpy
- opencv, PIL
- Pytorch
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN
- Recurrent Neural Networks, RNN. LSTM

### Computer Vision basics
